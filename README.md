Stock Forecast Analysis
=======================

Overview
--------

This project implements an end-to-end pipeline for forecasting stock prices using machine learning. It downloads historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, processes the data with feature engineering, trains an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict future prices, and evaluates the model's performance using metrics (e.g. RMSE) and visualizations.

The project demonstrates:

-   **Data Acquisition:** Download historical stock data using the `yfinance` library.
-   **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering:** Clean the data, parse dates, and compute technical indicators such as moving averages and daily returns.
-   **Model Building & Training:** Construct and train an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
-   **Evaluation:** Assess model performance by computing RMSE and visualizing predictions against actual values.
-   **Reproducibility:** Use a virtual environment and a `requirements.txt` file to ensure consistency.

Installation
------------

### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.11.9** (or a compatible version)
-   **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/stock-forecast-analysis.git
cd stock-forecast-analysis

```

### Set Up a Virtual Environment

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```
& "C:\Users\Dath\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe" -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

```

**On macOS/Linux:**

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

```

### Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment active, run:

```
pip install numpy pandas yfinance matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras jupyter mlflow

```

Then, generate a `requirements.txt` file:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt

```

Usage
-----

Run the following modules in sequence from the project root directory.

### 1\. Download Raw Stock Data

This module downloads historical stock data (e.g., for AAPL) and saves it in the `data/` folder.

```
python src/data_loader.py

```

### 2\. Feature Engineering

Process the raw data to add features such as moving averages and daily returns. This creates a processed data file.

```
python src/feature_engineering.py

```

### 3\. Train the Forecasting Model

Train the LSTM model using the processed data. The trained model is saved in the `experiments/` folder.

```
python src/model.py

```

### 4\. Evaluate the Model

Results
-------

-   **RMSE:**\
    The model evaluation yielded an RMSE of approximately 3.43 (this value may vary depending on your training parameters and data).
-    ### **Key Insights from the Forecast:**

     #### **1\. Prediction Accuracy and Trend Capture**

-   The predicted stock price (**red line**) closely follows the actual stock price (**blue line**), suggesting a **highly effective forecasting model**.
-   The model successfully captures:
    -   The **long-term upward trend** of Apple's stock.
    -   Short-term **volatility and fluctuations** in stock price movements.

    #### **2\. RMSE Analysis (3.4)**

-   With an **RMSE of 3.4**, the average deviation between predicted and actual stock prices is relatively **low**.
-   Given that Apple's stock price fluctuates between **$20 and $180** in the dataset, an RMSE of 3.4 represents a **small margin of error**.
-   This suggests that the model is **well-optimized** and **performs reliably** for forecasting purposes.

    #### **3\. Model Strengths**

-   The model maintains **tight alignment with actual stock movements**, indicating:
    -   **Strong learning from historical patterns.**
    -   **Minimal overfitting or underfitting.**
-   Even in periods of **high volatility**, the predictions remain accurate with only minor deviations.

    #### **4\. Potential Areas for Improvement**

Despite the strong performance, there are **possible enhancements**:

-   **Fine-tune hyperparameters** (if using an LSTM, ARIMA, or other ML model) to reduce minor deviations.
-   **Incorporate external factors** such as:
    -   **Market sentiment analysis** (Twitter, financial news).
    -   **Macroeconomic indicators** (interest rates, inflation).
    -   **Earnings reports & company announcements.**
-   **Expand training data** to include **more historical data** and **multiple timeframes** (e.g., hourly vs. daily prices).
-   **Experiment with deep learning** techniques like **Transformers** or hybrid models to further improve accuracy.

### **Business Implications for Apple Investors**

-   Given the **high prediction accuracy**, this model could be **useful for investment decisions**.
-   **Short-term traders** (e.g., swing traders) may still need additional tools to handle **intraday volatility**.
-   **Long-term investors** can **leverage the model** to identify macro trends and potential entry/exit points.
-   **Visualizations:**\
    Check the generated evaluation plot (saved in the `experiments/` folder or displayed during evaluation) to see how well the model's predictions match the actual stock prices.

Future Work
-----------

Potential improvements and extensions include:

-   **Hyperparameter Tuning:**\
    Adjust the LSTM architecture (number of layers, neurons, epochs, batch size, etc.) to enhance performance.
-   **Feature Expansion:**\
    Incorporate additional technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) or external data sources.
-   **Multiple Stocks:**\
    Extend the pipeline to download and forecast data for multiple stocks.
-   **Deployment:**\
    Create a web application using Flask or Streamlit to deploy your forecasting model.
-   **Experiment Tracking:**\
    Enhance experiment tracking using MLflow.
